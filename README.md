Function Name: _safeTransfer
Block Explorer Link: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f#code

Function Code: 

```
function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint value) private {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(SELECTOR, to, value));
    require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), 'UniswapV2: TRANSFER_FAILED');
}
```

Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: `abi.encodeWithSelector, call`

Purpose: The `_safeTransfer` function is a private function designed to safely transfer tokens from one address to another. It ensures that the transfer is successful and decodes the returned data to verify the outcome.

Detailed Usage: 

1.	Encoding:
	•	abi.encodeWithSelector(SELECTOR, to, value) is used to encode the function call with the appropriate selector and parameters.
	•	SELECTOR is a constant that represents the transfer(address,uint256) function selector.
	•	This encoding creates the calldata necessary for the low-level call to the token contract.
2.	Low-Level Call:
	•	token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(SELECTOR, to, value)) performs a low-level call to the token contract with the encoded data.
	•	The call function returns two values: success (a boolean indicating whether the call succeeded) and data (the returned data from the call).
3.	Decoding:
	•	abi.decode(data, (bool)) is used to decode the returned data to check if the transfer was successful.
	•	The require statement ensures that the call was successful and the returned data indicates a successful transfer, otherwise it reverts with ‘UniswapV2: TRANSFER_FAILED’.

Impact: `The _safeTransfer` function is crucial for ensuring secure token transfers within the Uniswap protocol. 
By utilizing abi.encodeWithSelector and call, it dynamically interacts with various ERC-20 token contracts, enabling flexibility and security. 
This function helps prevent failed transfers and ensures that tokens are handled correctly, contributing to the overall reliability and robustness of the Uniswap protocol.
